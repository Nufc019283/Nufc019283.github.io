<H1>FAVORITE SPORTS TEAMS</h1>
<p> Having lived in New England since I was born, I've always been a supporter of the Celtics, New England Patriots and the New England Revolution. When it comes to hockey however, my mom grew up in Washington, MO which is about 2 hours outside of St. Louis and I have always been a big fan of the St. Louis Blues. </p>
