					<h1>WELCOME TO BEN LEVERETT'S HOMEPAGE </h1>

<p> My full name is Benjahmin Katahdin Leverett. I was born and raised in North Yarmouth,
Maine which is a small town about 10 minutes north of Portland. I am the middle child of
three boys. My older brother's name is Elijah and my younger brother's name is Ezra. My
mother's name is Patty and my father's name is Stephen. I am currently pursuing an undergraduate
degree in Finance at the University of Maine in Orono, Maine and hope to one day become a 
financial planner. My main interests include photography and sports and I am an avid 
Newcastle United supporter. </p>
